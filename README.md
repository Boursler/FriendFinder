# FriendFinder
## FriendFinder is a compatability app
It will take the results of a survey and return the name of the most compatible friend, along with a link to an image of themselves they provide. The survey consists of 10 questions whose answers are ranked from 1-5. The absolute value of the difference between responders' answers is found and returned to calculate a sense of overall compatability. 
* From the home page, follow the link to the survey:
